  He joins the School of Architecture of Montevideo in 1952. During his freshman
  year, he takes part in
  <strong>
    architect Mario Paysée Reyes's
  </strong>
  workshop. Then he joins
  <strong>
    architect Carlos Gómez Gavazzo’s
  </strong>
  workshop -a great master of architecture- where he stays until the end of his
  academic years.
  <strong>
    Architect Luis Basil and Assistant Professor architect Ramón González
    Almeida
  </strong>
  -among others- were also part of this workshop. The latter gave him guidelines
  in the fields of creativity, coherence and the importance of structural order.
  He works in his firm until 1955, when
  <strong>
    architect González Almeida
  </strong> travels to the USA and then settles in Venezuela. This is when
  <strong>
    López Rey
  </strong>
  who is still a student, takes the reigns of
  <strong>
    Ramón González Almeida’s
  </strong>
  firm, though he remains professionally represented by the firm of architects
  <strong>
    Alberto Muñoz del Campo
  </strong>,
  <strong>
    Enrique Muñoz
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
    Guillermo Gómez Platero
  </strong>.
  It is in this firm where he starts
  working on several architectural projects, such as a call for tender organized
  by Banco Hipotecario. This project was deeply appreciated by
  <strong>
    architect Rino Levi, juror
  </strong>.
  <strong>
    Architect Rodolfo López Rey
  </strong>
  meets
  <strong>
    architect Paul Rudolph
  </strong>
  during the latter’s visit to
  <strong>
    architect Gómez Gavazzo’s
  </strong>
  workshop in the School of Architecture. Here, he conducts an excellent class.
  <strong>
    Rodolfo López Rey
  </strong>
    admires
  <strong>
    Paul Rudolph
  </strong>
  for his homes in Sarasota (Florida, USA), published in the Arts and
  Architecture journal. Other important architects who were his role models
  during his academic years were:
  <strong>
    Le Corbusier (Charles Édouard Jeanneret), Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies
    van der Rohe, Philip Johnson, Ernesto Rogers, Charles Eames and Harry
    Seidler.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In 1958, while studying for his last university exams, he is invited by
  <strong>
    architect Leonel Viera
  </strong>
  - designer of the hanging bridge over Maldonado stream in Punta del Este - to
  prepare a draft for
  <a href="#" data-project-prefix="Edificio_Centenario" class="js-project">
    <em>
      Centenario
    </em>
    Building
  </a>,
  located on Centenario and 8 de Octubre Avenues, in Montevideo. This work was
  completed by the
  <strong>
    architect Alfredo Nebel Farini
  </strong>.
</p>
<p>
  He graduates as an Architect by the end of 1959.
</p>
<p>
  By then, having already initiated several works together with
  <strong>
    architect Guillermo Gómez Platero,
  </strong>
  he takes part in several projects, such as
  <a href="#" data-project-prefix="Finisterre" class="js-project">
    <em>

  In 1963 he takes up teaching as a 1st year assistant of Isern workshop, held by
  <strong>
    architect Herrán
  </strong>,
  at the School of Architecture, and continues working for the firm.
</p>
<p>
  By the end of 1963, the Italian Government awards him with a scholarship and
  he travels to Europe. He studies at Milan Polytechnic University with
  Professor Sacchi. In February 1964 he meets Architect Ernesto Rogers in his
  Milan firm  with whom he has an unforgettable conversation. López Rey then
  visits the Velasca Tower, one of the most singular works in all of Rogers’
  extensive career. He resides and works in Milan until the end of 1964. There
  he meets a valuable Italian cultural group, integrated by the outstanding
  <strong>
    painter Paolo Schiavocampo
  </strong>
  and the
  <strong>
    sculptor Pino Spagnulo
  </strong>,
  among others.
</p>
<p>
  He is invited to design the reform works of an 18th century palace at Piazzale
  Baracca de Milano. He also designs a series of apartments and shops at
  Cinisello Balsamo, a suburban area of Milan. Finally, he designs a project for
  the same company aimed at the construction of pre-manufactured houses with a
  metal structure. The assembly parts are built at a car assembly factory.
  During this stage he creates the
  <a href="#" data-project-prefix="Fantasias_Italianas" class="js-project">
    Italian fantasies
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of 1964, he is invited by
  <strong>
    architect Ramón González Almeida
  </strong>,
  who was already residing in Venezuela, to teach architecture at the School of
  Architecture of Mérida, Venezuela. He decides to return to Montevideo, but
  before doing so he travels to several cities in Spain, France, Belgium, the
  Netherlands and Germany. In this last country he visits the Ulm School of
  Design and meets its director,
  <strong>
    Tomás Maldonado
  </strong>.
  He could not forget the intellectual and monastic climate that reigned there.
  Later, when in Switzerland, he tried to meet with
  <strong>
    Max Bill
  </strong>,
  founder of said school, who at the time was not in Zurich. He ends his journey
  revisiting Italy and finally Greece where he stays for over a month visiting
  Athens, Mykonos, Santorini, Delos, Paros and Crete.
</p>
<p>
  Back in Montevideo, in 1965 he returns to the firm and continues teaching as
  an assistant professor at
  <strong>
    architect Herrán's
  </strong>
  workshop, in the School of Architecture. There he reencounters his students
  from 1963, who are now in 3rd year. Prominent students:
  <strong>
    Enrique Cohe, Roberto Alberti, Oscar Corlazzoli, Juan Elbio Nicola,
    Armando González
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
    Julio Bazzano
  </strong>,
  among others.
</p>
<p>
  Since his trip to Italy in October 1963 and until his return in early 1965,
  architect Alfredo Rudich temporarily joins the firm, invited by architect
  López Rey. During this period, the construction of Poyo Roc Residential House
  is finished.
</p>
<p>
  Since 1965 the firm starts developing a new plastic arts expression that
  leaves aside, at times, its initial structural language making way for strong,
  white architectural volumes. This language was influenced by the Mediterranean
  culture of Southern Italy cities such as Ostuni, the Greek islands, Santorini,
  Mykonos and various cities in Andalucía. Thus, the firm is in search of a new
  language, which finds its reflection in many residential houses as well as in
  some buildings built in Punta del Este and Montevideo, namely:

<p>
  The buildings El Fortín, Paz Marina, Arrecifes and Yacht, as well as many
  residential houses especially reflect this architectural language. They
  continue using exposed reinforced concrete in a significant series of works
  developed thanks to
  <strong>
    accountant Luis E. Lecueder’s
  </strong>
  enterprising talent. This series starts with
  <em>
    Berna
  </em>
  Building in 1969, which precedes the creation of
  <strong>
    SAFEMA
  </strong>
  (Sociedad Anónima Fomento Edilicio de Maldonado - Maldonado Building
  Development Corporation). The main reason for the success of SAFEMA was its
  incorporation and integration; a group of friends from different fields. As
  the Chair, Luis Lecueder, who did an impeccable job running the company, was
  supported by the management of the López Rey - Gómez Platero Architects firm.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Luis E. Lecueder
  </strong>,
  accountant, was the true creator of the
  <strong>
    SAFEMA
  </strong>
  (Sociedad Anónima de Fomendo Edilicio de Maldonado- Maldonado Building
  Development Corporation) structure. Together with his talent, commitment,
  optimism, integrity and outstanding professionalism he accomplished important
  investments during complicated financial times in Uruguay. As a consequence,
  thanks to his important and memorable administration, so many high-quality
  buildings were erected in Punta del Este and Montevideo. We were fortunate to
  be able to walk by his side during those long and unforgettable years. Sadly,
  he left us too soon, although his son,
  <strong>
    Carlos Alberto Lecueder
  </strong>,
  was able to carry on so many new and high-quality buildings with the same
  conditions he still brings to the table today.
</p>
<p>
  Then, the three most prestigious, longstanding and excellent real estate
  companies in the area,
  <strong>
    Gattas, Sader y Paullier
  </strong>,
  start participating. A triangle of excellent professional management was
  consolidated. First, there was a tender for the reinforced concrete works,
  starting with the electrical and sanitary installations. Then there was a
  tender for masonry work with the same company or a more convenient one. After
  that, all subcontracts which had to be involved in the process at a strict
  time were written. The firm approved payments, if required, according to the
  quality of work and timeliness thereof.
  <strong>
    The Lecueder firm
  </strong>
  received this information and immediately, after checking, payments were made.
  The construction company did not manage the funds. They went directly to the
  subcontractor or supplier. This allowed those involved in the work to promptly
  receive the money for the finished work. This ended with the tradition that
  involved the main company receiving the total amount of certificates. As a
  result,
  <strong>
    SAFEMA
  </strong>
  earned a solid reputation in Montevideo and Punta del Este, which enabled it
  to do a great number of works. The apartments were always ready within the
  agreed time.
</p>
<p>
  This period sees a return to a structural expression and to the use of
  reinforced concrete as a plastic expression. During this time,
  <strong>
    architects Enrique Cohe
  </strong>
  –in 1973- and
  <strong>
    Roberto Alberti
  </strong>
  –in 1976- join as members of the firm. At first,
  <strong>
    architect Enrique Cohe
  </strong>
  collaborates by managing the construction works in Punta del Este. Then, he
  enters the project area, while
  <strong>
    architect Roberto Alberti
  </strong>
  works as an important collaborator in the area of budgeting, management and
  administration of the construction works.
</p>
<p>
  In 1976, after
  <em>
    Berna
  </em>
  Building was finished, López Rey travels to Europe and reunites with the
  <strong>
    painter Paolo Schiavocampo
  </strong> and the
  <strong>
    sculptor Pino Spagnulo
  </strong>,
  important figures of Italian painting and sculpture. He then travels through Italy, France, Spain and Greece.
</p>
<p>
  The following construction works were carried out together with
  <strong>

  In 1975,
  <strong>
    Goar Mestre
  </strong>
  - an important Cuban businessman, formed in the USA and founder of important
  media companies in La Habana, Caracas and Buenos Aires- starts working in
  <strong>
    SAFEMA
  </strong>
  as a financial partner. His participation was fundamental for achieving
  perfection in many details of our projects. He had a great relationship with
  <strong>
    accountant Luis Lecueder
  </strong>
  and our firm. Partly because of his intervention, the four
  <em>
    Malecones
  </em>
  were born.
